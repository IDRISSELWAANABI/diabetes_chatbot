# Medical Chatbot using Llama2
# Introduction 

This project is an innovative application of artificial intelligence and natural language processing that aims to create a chatbot that can interact with humans using natural language and provide them with useful and relevant information about various medical topics. The chatbot leverages the power of Llama2, a cutting-edge language model that can generate high-quality and engaging text and code in response to prompts, to produce answers to common medical questions, such as symptoms, causes, prevention, and treatment of different diseases and conditions. The chatbot also uses Langchain Medical Bot, a trustworthy and comprehensive medical knowledge base, to access and verify the information that it provides to the users. The chatbot is designed to be a helpful and friendly assistant that can improve the health literacy and awareness of the public, as well as the accessibility, affordability, and quality of healthcare services.
