# healthcare_chatbot
This project aims to develop a healthcare chatbot specifically tailored for diabetic individuals to assist them in managing their condition and improving their overall health. The chatbot will provide personalized diabetes management guidance, educational resources, continuous monitoring and alerts, and personalized feedback and motivation.

## Features
The chatbot can answer questions about symptoms, causes, prevention, and treatment of various diseases and conditions, such as diabetes, asthma, COVID-19, etc.

The chatbot can also provide general health information and tips, such as how to improve sleep quality, how to reduce stress, how to maintain a healthy weight, etc.

The chatbot uses Llama2 to generate responses based on the userâ€™s input and the information from Langchain Medical Bot, a reliable and comprehensive medical knowledge base.

The chatbot has a user-friendly interface that allows the user to type or speak their questions and receive text or voice responses.

The chatbot has a robust and scalable backend that handles the communication between the interface, Llama2, and Langchain Medical Bot.

The chatbot is finetuned with Gradient service, a cloud platform for machine learning development and deployment, that provides free GPUs and easy integration with Llama2.
